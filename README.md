Problem Statement
--

The existing system of the restaurant is maintained manually making it time consuming and tedious.<br>
-	All data is maintained manually, increasing the chances of error and complexity of maintenance. <br>
-	The same data is entered every day, which is a redundant process.<br>
-	No database available for the employees, customers, and the prime members.<br>
-	There is no system of reserving the table online.<br>
-	The food cannot be ordered online for delivery.<br>
-	The option of going contactless in the restaurant during covid was not available.<br>
-	Audit of inventory and transactions is difficult.<br>
