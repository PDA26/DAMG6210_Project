##Problem Statement

The existing system of the restaurant is maintained manually making it time consuming and tedious.
-	All data is maintained manually, increasing the chances of error and complexity of maintenance. 
-	The same data is entered every day, which is a redundant process.
-	No database available for the employees, customers, and the prime members.
-	There is no system of reserving the table online.
-	The food cannot be ordered online for delivery.
-	The option of going contactless in the restaurant during covid was not available.
-	Audit of inventory and transactions is difficult.
